   Hypothesis Report: Student Grade Prediction Based on Screen Time

   This project explores the relationship between student screen time and academic performance by predicting grades using two different machine learning models: Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

    The project focused on evaluating the models' performance under different conditions:

    -  **Baseline Models**: Initial models were built and tested on the raw data, without any feature engineering.

    - **Feature Engineering**: The models were then re-evaluated after applying two common scaling techniques: MinMax Scaling and Standardization. These techniques were used to normalize the data and potentially improve model accuracy.

    - The performance of all models was measured using the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** , a standard metric for regression tasks that quantifies the average squared difference between the predicted and actual grades.

    - This approach allowed for a direct comparison of the models' effectiveness and demonstrated the impact of different data preprocessing methods on prediction accuracy.
